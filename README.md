## 🧠 Overview

TinDog is a front‑end project inspired by real startup landing pages.  
It showcases a clean hero section, feature highlights, testimonials, pricing tiers, and a footer — all styled using Bootstrap 5.

This project helped me practice responsive design, Bootstrap utilities, grid layouts, and component structure while keeping the tone playful and visually appealing.
